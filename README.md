# Restaurant_Review_Classification
This python script is used to classify the review of restaurant as positive or negative reviews. I have made use of the nltk library for this where I used to to remove the stop words and also did stemming for the words. The words were then fitted into a bag of words model which is later then used to classify the reviews. I used multiple algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tress and Random Forest for the classification process and was able to acheive an accuracy of 81% using the SVM model.
